    <p>Hi, I'm **Tống Phan Kim Thạch**, a student majoring in **Software Engineering** at the Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City (IUH).  
Although I’m still early in my career, I always remind myself to stay humble and curious. I believe that learning never ends, and I’m constantly seeking new opportunities to improve my skills, gain real-world experience, and collaborate with people in the field of software development and technology.</p>
